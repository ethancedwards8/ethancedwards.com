## Hello World! How does this site work?

This is my blog, which features some pretty cool stuff. For example, code highlighting, quote changers, and an about page.

Code highlighting!
<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
{`
const doStuff = () => {
	return console.log('hey');
}
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

It is built on NextJS, React, and Express (although not much express is used.). I also use some pretty cool smaller libraries for various different functionalities.

Blog posts are written in MDX.

Additionally, the cool quote changer on the main page is powered by an [API](https://github.com/ethancedwards8/ethancedwards-quotes/) that I wrote! Powered by Python and Flask.

Although at the time of writing, the site may not be the prettiest, I am confident that it will look good in enough time.

You can view the site source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ethancedwards8/ethancedwards.com), feel free to submit pull requests if you see anything you can improve on!

## A bit about me

Right now, I am a full time student, working concurrently on both my high school and college degrees. Despite being a student, I do work as consulting and engineering for various small businesses around me. I also write for [StorageReview](https://storagereview.com) occasionally. I have been using Linux full time since 7th grade, and my current distro of choice is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) with LVM on LUKS. My daily driver is a FrameWork laptop, and I have a desktop computer with a Ryzen 2600X alongside 16G of RAM. These machines however are dwarfed in power by my homelab, which consists of a cluster of Raspberry Pis ;). My homelab is currently hosting my site, but it may move locations in the future, but that's for another post.

I also have hobbies outside of tech. I am a cuber, language learner, and mathematics lover. I am teaching myself Spanish through [Refold](https://refold.la), of which I am a huge proponent. This topic also deserves its own post. I plan on writing here a lot, although, everyone says that.

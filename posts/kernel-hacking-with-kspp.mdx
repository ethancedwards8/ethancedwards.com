## Linux Kernel Hacking

Ever since I started using Linux in 7th grade, I have been fascinated by and fervently
believed in the Free Software Movement and the projects that emerged as a result. One
of these projects is the Linux Kernel. Started as a small hobby project and to solve
a real problem by developer Linus Torvalds, it is now the most widely used operating
system in the world. While nowadays it is mostly funded and developed by corporations,
non-trivial amounts of development are done by hobbyists and hackers. Some people work
on simple drivers for pieces of hardware that they have that are not yet supported,
while others are trying to bring [Linux to Apple hardware](https://asahilinux.org/ "Asahi Linux").

Naturally, I wanted to join the community of kernel hackers (or contributors). I
found Greg Kroah-Hartman's [video at FOSDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLBrBBImJt4) showing how to write and submit a kernel patch (a fancy word for a piece of code).
For those who do not know, Greg KH is Linus's right-hand man. Greg does it all, and
is one of the most respected members of the kernel community. Also, funnily enough,
while this video was made more than 15 years ago, it is still 100% accurate and relevant.
For better or worse, not many projects can say their development process has remained unchanged for 15 years.

After watching the video, I searched through the directories of projects I was interested
in. At the time, I was familiarizing myself with SELinux, so I looked through the source
tree to try to grok how everything worked and learn the development process. Thankfully,
I was fortunate enough that [Paul Moore](https://paul-moore.com/about), the maintainer of the SELinux subsystem, was
kind and patient enough to take [my code](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=65d96351b135c2a694814520a6031f3721020ba9 "My SELinux Contribution").
While it did nothing but appease the static code analyzers, it was exciting for 14 year
old me! I had contributed to the most prolific operating system in the world. Due to
SELinux's use in Android, my code runs on billions of devices around the world. ;)

A few weeks after that, I started poking around in the `staging/` directory. This location
folder holds all the drivers that have been submitted and accepted upstream but are not yet
parts of the core kernel. They remain in `staging/` until the code meets style guides and
features are more fully flushed out. This is where most beginner contributors start. I
fixed a few documentation errors in the [comedi driver](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f6a1a425cbb74f4836f2e21e0110330c65e33ad2).
Greg KH, who I mentioned above, maintains the `staging/` directory. This means that he
was the one who responded to my emails and accepted my code. Pretty neat!

## The Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP)

Most of my earlier contributions were pretty insignificant. However, I have found a way
to meaningfully contribute needed and valuable security fixes to the Linux Kernel via the Kernel Self Protection Project.
Founded by Google employee [Kees Cook](https://github.com/kees "Kees Cook's GitHub"), the project is dedicated to making the kernel
more secure and more resilient to attacks. Specifically, his work focuses on making
C safer by default and fixing bugs long before they are ever discovered. [Gustavo Silva](https://embeddedor.com/ "Gustavo's website")
is another very active contributor. In fact, he has reviewed some of my code, which
is neat considering his presentations are responsible for my involvement in the KSPP. Thanks, Gustavo!

While I may not have the knowledge to rewrite a driver from scratch to be more
performant or have the skills to reverse engineer Apple hardware, I am capable
of critical thinking and analyzing small sections of code in detail. This is what
the KSPP is about. Most of the changes within the project
are small changes: a few lines of code here or there. Some are as simple as changing a single
character from the `strncpy` function to `strscpy`! But there is a purpose behind
each patch.

There are over 100 open issues on the [KSPP's GitHub tracker](https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues).
Each one focuses on a different part of the Kernel. While some issues focus on
working towards the enabling of a compiler flag that hardens the kernel, some are
design changes and code changes. One of the easier ones to learn about and understand
is the migration from [open coded arithmetic to helper functions](https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/162).
Essentially, instead of using `kzalloc(nr * sizeof(*int), ...)` we should use
`kcalloc(nr, sizeof(*int), ...)`. This change not only increases code readability,
but there are built in protections within `kcalloc` against overflows due to casting or memory weirdness.
This is a really easy way to contribute and make the code verifiably safer and better.

The past few weeks I have sent a litany of patches on to the mailing lists changing
code in the [erofs](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a78c5c2269e39544fab4140105f55fca4502e915), gpu/drm, scheduler, thermal, and sound subsystems. This has been an excellent way
to practice using tools like `b4`, `git rebase`, writing good commit messages, and
learning the netiquette of email-based workflows. I even found a set of code to
practice sending multiple patches, or a series, at once. I sent [4 patches](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250227-amd-display-v1-0-52a060a78d08@ethancedwards.com/) for
various AMD drivers in `gpu/drm/amd`.

## Getting started

For those who are interested, I recommend watching the above video and reading
the [official kernel documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html) on contributing.
After cloning the source code, run `git grep -n kzalloc | grep ' \* ' | grep -v ':\s\+\*'`
and find instances of code that can be improved! Sometimes while searching
for KSPP issues to fix, I come across ways to make the code better in other ways.
For example, in the sound subsection I removed more than 30 lines of code by
[combining two functions](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e576e7843c0d65b82d4092e5b386d9fbf5bc10c3).

So, my final advice for readers who are interested in learning to hack on the
kernel is to jump in! It takes some persistence, especially when learning the
tooling, but the effort is worth it. Find a subsystem that is interesting
and exciting and start poking around. Think of ways to improve code, break it,
fix it, and do it all over again. It is incredibly gratifying and rewarding
to have one's first contribution merged! If this little blog post has inspired
anyone to get started and submit their first patch, please CC me on the email
and I would be more than happy to review it and provide feedback.

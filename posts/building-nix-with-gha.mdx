## Background

I started using Nix and NixOS around four years ago because I appreciated the declarative
nature and features it brought. At the time,
I had an internship with a local web-hosting company and one of the problems we faced was
our bring-up process for provisioning new servers. One of the company's goals at the time
was simplifying the process so that an admin could run one command and we would have a
functional system that could integrate securely with our Docker Swarm.

We explored various tools like simple Bash scripts, more complex Python scripts, and even
Ansible (which is really just a glorified Python script), but each of them presented the
same issue: state. We did not have an easy way to keep track of when things changed.
Further, when we did push a change with Ansible or modified one of our scripts, we could
not guarantee that the change was made on each system without manually checking them
ourselves.

After some research and tinkering, I proposed that we try NixOS. We gave it a try and in a few weeks had switched
over most of the systems. While the company eventually switched back over to Debian, it
proved to be an invaluable experience using Nix in enterprise systems. Its (mostly)
stateless configuration options were exactly what I needed. The configuration files became
the single source of truth for our systems, and we did not have to worry about forgotten
packages and services becoming security vulnerabilities. If it was not in the file, it
was not on the system. This idea was only strengthened when we implemented [impermanence](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/).

At the same company, we had a variety of custom Docker images for products developed
in-house and others with some slight modifications for popular pieces of software like
WordPress. One of the tasks I was assigned was to create a CI (Continuous Integration) system that built and
pushed the Docker images to a container registry. In about a day, I figured out how to
integrate with GitLab CI and push to our instance's GitLab Container Registry. This was
my first taste of using CI to automate the DevOps process.

Nowadays, I use GitHub Actions (GHA) for a variety of jobs. For example, this website and the
APIs that support it are built by GitHub Actions. Each code repository has a Dockerfile
and GHA workflow file that builds an OCI image and pushes it to a registry.

While I was at this internship, I also started migrating my personal devices over to
NixOS. I went pretty deep down the rabbit hole. However, I started high school a few
months later, and with sports, extracurriculars, and homework, I mostly stopped
tinkering with NixOS and largely stepped away from Linux and the Open Source community.
A lot has changed since then!

As my high school graduation approaches and I start to have more free time, I have picked up some of
my old hobbies again. The past three months I have dived back into the world of NixOS and
resumed my contributions to [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs). Additionally,
I declared "nix bankruptcy" and rebuilt my [configuration](https://github.com/ethancedwards8/dotfiles/tree/master/.nix)
from scratch.

## Integrating GitHub Actions with my NixOS and nix-darwin configurations

This whole time, I had been thinking about how I could integrate my NixOS system and
nix-darwin (which offers NixOS-like reproducibility on MacOS) system configurations with
GitHub Actions like nixpkgs does. I thought I could benefit from automatic builds
that are cached by [Cachix](https://cachix.org), especially when building my Raspberry
Pi's configuration. It turns out, I'm not the only person who has thought of this. Domen Ko≈æar,
founder of Cachix, utilizes GitHub's free CI system to [build and apply](https://github.com/domenkozar/homelab/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
his system configurations to his computer automatically. While I do not need the CD (Continuous Deployment)
service offered by Cachix, I am a customer of Cachix's caching service. I decided to model my CI after his.

GitHub Action Workflows and Jobs are defined by YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory.
Below is the code that creates the jobs that run on the GitHub Actions runners. I use the
`x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-darwin` (MacOS), and `aarch64-linux` runners that are defined below. They
build my NixOS, nix-darwin, and NixOS-arm systems respectively. Apparently, the arm runners are
[a recent addition](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/148648#) to GitHub Actions and are experimentally supported.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="yaml">
{`
name: Build & Push

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build and Push Config
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm]
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
          - os: macos-latest
          - os: ubuntu-24.04-arm
    runs-on: \${{ matrix.os }}
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

After the runners are defined, we have to declare what they are actually going to do.
Below is the code that installs Nix into the GHAs runner environment. Cachix has an
action that nicely integrates with GHA to quickly install Nix and configure
pushing/pulling from Cachix.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="yaml">
{`
    steps:
      - run: sudo rm -rf /opt&
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@08dcb3a5e62fa31e2da3d490afc4176ef55ecd72 # v30
      - uses: cachix/cachix-action@v15
        with:
          name: ethancedwards8
          authToken: "\${{ secrets.CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN }}"
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Next is the actual building of each system. Obviously, MacOS cannot build Linux systems
and vice-versa (at least without the use of emulation/virtual machines, but that is
too much overhead when I can just use multiple runners). Consequently, I use conditional
statements to only build x86 targets on the x86 runner, Darwin targets on the MacOS runner,
and aarch64 targets on the ARM runner. The targets are the different Nix flake outputs
defined in my [configuration's `flake.nix`](https://github.com/ethancedwards8/dotfiles/blob/master/.nix/flake.nix).
At the very end of the file, Cachix will push the result of any of the builds to the
caching service, allowing my downstream computers to pull the results from them, saving
time and energy. Essentially, I am offloading the building of configuration files, USB
ISOs, development environments, and custom packages to GitHub.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="yaml">
{`
      - name: x86_64-linux Build
        if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
        run: nix build -L .nix#{nixvm,usb,archpc,devShell.x86_64-linux}

      - name: aarch64 Build
        if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-24.04-arm'
        run: nix build -L .nix#{nixrpi,devShell.aarch64-linux}

      - name: MacOS Build
        if: matrix.os == 'macos-latest'
        run: nix build -L .nix#{mbair,devShell.aarch64-darwin}

      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          cachix push ethancedwards8 .nix/result*
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

The biggest benefit I get from this setup is the building of a USB ISO that has my configurations
on it. It builds each time I make a change to my setup or update my inputs, meaning I always have
the freshest software and newest configurations that I can flash to a flash drive to use as a
portable Linux machine. Instead of having to build it manually each time I need it, GHA automatically
builds it and Cachix stores it. When I need it, I run `nix build` locally and it is retrieved from
Cachix and downloaded into my local Nix store.

While my use case is somewhat academic and not super practical, there are instances
where I, and others, have used GitHub Actions to automate and accelerate the development process
in software development. Popular new terminal emulator [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)
written in Zig is an excellent example. Their developers use Nix to build and create development
environments that are built by GitHub Actions and cached. This allows users and programmers to
do work faster instead of waiting for things to compile or Nix to finish evaluating.

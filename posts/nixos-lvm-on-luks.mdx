## Background

I have been a long time Linux user (since March of 2020, guess why? ;) ). Part
of the reason I began to use Linux and continue to use it is the increased security
and privacy that it offers. Not only am I confident that Microsoft, Google, or Apple
is not spying on me, but I am afforded the ability to take my security into my own hands.

While there are a number of strategies to enhance a computer's software security like utilizing
SELinux, AppArmor, or hardening the SSH configuration, few measures protect a computer
from physical tampering like disk encryption does. It does not matter how secure a device's
software stack is if it is physically compromised. Full disk encryption is the easiest way 
to protect against low effort but high-yield physical attacks. Using LUKS encryption is the
easiest way to do that. LVM on top of it allows me even more flexibility with how I organize my data.

As I prepare to start my studies at Harvard University, I anticipate the unfortunate
reality that I may somehow lose my laptop or that my laptop is taken, intentionally or not.
By securing my device with encryption, I am protecting myself against unauthorized data access.
Additionally, using NixOS allows me to verify that my configuration is as it seems. Any change
to my system would be overwritten by my declarative NixOS configuration switching. Also, using
NixOS allows me to easily replicate my system configuration across multiple devices and quickly
reinstall my system in the event of a theft or drive failure. I'll stop evangelizing and start
explaining now.

As a general warning, this article will be fairly technical. I will assume that the readers
know the basics of filesystems and disk partitioning, but will explain the disk encryption-
and NixOS-specific content. Also, these steps are specific to my 11th Gen 13" Framework with an
NVMe drive. Other computer's specifics may vary.

A more advanced and NixOS-like solution may be an encrypted ZFS root with [impermanence](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/), however
LVM on LUKS is the more traditional way to accomplish the same goal. Additionally, I am much more
comfortable with LVM, LUKS, and ext4 than I am with ZFS. Neither is better or worse, just different.

## The Disk

The process for preparing the disk is pretty uniform across distributions. I learned much of this
from the Arch Wiki when I used Arch Linux full time. Skilled Linux users can probably skim this section
and start at the NixOS section.

We'll start by partioning my disk into two parts with `fdisk /dev/nvme0n1`:
1. 1G partition with Type 1: `UEFI boot`
2. Remaining free space with Type 23: `Linux x86_64 root`

The first partition will be the unencrypted `FAT32` UEFI boot partition. The second will be the
the LUKS encrypted partition that will be organized with LVM. However, before we start using
LVM or formatting filesystems, we must actually encrypt and unlock our disk. I suggest adding
labels to make configuring the NixOS hardware settings easier later.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`
cryptsetup luksFormat --label=NIXOS_LUKS /dev/nvme0n1p2
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptlvm
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

After unlocking the encrypted partition and mapping it to the `cryptlvm` name, we can create
our LVM Physical Volumes (pv), Volume Groups (vg), and Logical Volumes (lv). While understanding how each works
is not vital for setting up the system, I encourage the reader to research each topic in more detail
at the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Preparing_the_logical_volumes) 
and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-lvm-concepts-terminology-and-operations).

Now is a good time to mention why we are using LVM when LUKS handles all of our encryption needs.
LVM is the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for Linux. LVM allows us to create multiple logical
partition-like volumes under the encrypted LUKS partition. This means that we could have lv's for
home partitions, root partitions, var partitions, etc. Here, I am choosing to create lv's for a
swap partition and a root partition.

Please note that I am leaving `256M` at the end of the lv to allow for using `e2scrub` with `ext4`.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`
pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
vgcreate NIXOS_LVM /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
lvcreate -L 16G -n SWAP NIXOS_LVM
lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n ROOT NIXOS_LVM
lvreduce -L -256M NIXOS_LVM/ROOT
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

After setting up LVM, we can start formatting the volumes. I am electing to use `ext4`
because I am confident in it and am very familiar with it. I believe using other file systems
like `xfs` would be possible too. `FAT32` is required for UEFI boot partitions, so that makes
our decision easy! After formatting the drives, we can mount them. This is all pretty standard stuff. 

Please note that again I am using labels to make things easier on myself later.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`
# formatting
mkfs.fat -F32 -n BOOTFS /dev/nvme0n1p1
mkswap -L SWAPFS /dev/NIXOS_LVM/SWAP
mkfs.ext4 -L ROOTFS /dev/NIXOS_LVM/ROOT
# mounting
swapon /dev/NIXOS_LVM/SWAP
mount /dev/NIXOS_LVM/ROOT /mnt
mount --mkdir /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Now our disk is fully setup. Let's start the NixOS installation!

## NixOS

Thankfully, this part is pretty simple thanks to NixOS's tooling. We generate the
config (and I prefer a flakified version), make edits where necessary, and then install. 
After installing, we enter the system and can start editing our config in more detail if
necessary.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`
nixos-generate-config --root /mnt --flake
$EDITOR /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
nixos-install --root /mnt --flake /mnt/etc/nixos#nixos
nixos-enter --root /mnt
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Below, I would like to point out some required additions to the config to ensure
that the bootloader is configured to correctly handle LVM on LUKS on reboot.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="nix">
{`
{
    # ensures the systemd boot loader is installed
    boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
    boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;

    # IMPORTANT: without these additions the LUKS device will not be found
    # and therefore decrypted, making boot fail
    boot.initrd.kernelModules = [ "dm-snapshot" "cryptd" ];
    boot.initrd.luks.devices."cryptroot".device = "/dev/disk/by-label/NIXOS_LUKS";

    # the system will automatically generate these but will use uuid's instead of
    # labels. Labels provide more flexibility and allow for an easier reinstall.
    fileSystems."/" =
        { device = "/dev/disk/by-label/ROOTFS";
          fsType = "ext4";
        };

    fileSystems."/boot" =
        { device = "/dev/disk/by-label/BOOTFS";
          fsType = "vfat";
          options = [ "fmask=0022" "dmask=0022" ];
        };

    swapDevices =
        [ { device = "/dev/disk/by-label/SWAPFS"; }
        ];
}
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

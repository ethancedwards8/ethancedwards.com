## Lord of the Flies
As part of my senior British Literature class in high school, we read 
Lord of the Flies by William Golding. One of the questions that was
asked in class was if the boys stranded on the island were changed by
the island or if the boys had a natural propensity for violence?

I will not go into the conversation we had in class, but I came up with
and will consider the following question: Can a peron's morality come 
from reason or logic exlusively? Many individual's derive their moral
framework from their religion. Irreligious folks rely on society's 
teachings to decide what is moral and what is wrong. I wonder,
can a logical individual who is never taught morality derive a moral 
framework for the world without religion or society? If so, how do we
get there?
